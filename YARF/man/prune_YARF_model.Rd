the tree structure.}
\usage{
prune_YARF_model(yarf_mod, prune_if_script, trees_to_prune = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{yarf_mod}{The YARF model whose trees are to be pruned.}

\item{prune_if_script}{A custom javascript function (see below) which determines the pruning of 
                            a node (i.e. deletes the node's children and sets the node to a leaf and 
                            then sets a y_hat using the assign function).

                            function pruneIf(node)\{ //node is of type YARF.YARFNode

                                ...
                                
                                return boolean //true if this node is to be pruned
                            \}}

\item{trees_to_prune}{An array of indices which specify which of the trees to prune. The default is \code{NULL}
which means all of them.}
