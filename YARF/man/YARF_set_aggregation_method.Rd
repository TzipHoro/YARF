\usage{
YARF_set_aggregation_method(yarf_mod, aggregation_script)
}
\arguments{
\item{yarf_mod}{The yarf model object}

\item{aggregation_script}{A custom javascript function which aggregates the predictions in the trees for one observations 
                                    into one scalar prediction (see below). 

                                    function aggregateYhatsIntoOneYhat(y_hats, yarf)\{ //y_hats is an array of doubles of size num_trees
                                        //and yarf provides access to the entire random forest object if needed (of type YARF.YARF)

                                        ...

                                        return double //this is the final predicted value aggregated from all tree predictions

                                    \}}
}
\value{
The yarf model object
}
\description{
This function sets custom code to be run when the Forest is making a decision from its many trees. This function should be run
before you run \code{predict} or \code{YARF_update_with_oob_results} so that your custom aggregation can be employed. This function 
is optional as the default aggregation method corresponds to (a) the sample average for regression and (b) the modal category 
for classification. One further note of warning: once this script has been set, it will be retained in the YARF model until 
this function is run again for this YARF model object with a new aggregation script.
