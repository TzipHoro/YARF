\title{A fully customizable Random Forests implementation}
\usage{
YARF(X = NULL, y = NULL, Xy = NULL, Xother = NULL, num_trees = 500,
  boostrap_indices = NULL, mtry = NULL, mtry_fun = NULL,
  nodesize = NULL, nodesize_fun = NULL, cost_calc_fun = NULL,
  node_assign_fun = NULL, aggregation_fun = NULL, shared_funs = NULL,
  use_missing_data = FALSE, use_missing_data_dummies_as_covars = FALSE,
  replace_missing_data_with_x_j_bar = TRUE, mem_cache_for_speed = TRUE,
  covariates_to_permute = NULL, serialize = FALSE, seed = NULL,
  wait = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, debug_log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The data frame of training data}

\item{y}{The training responses}

\item{Xy}{The data frame of training data where the last column is responses}

\item{Xother}{Other data that is used in the training but the RF doesn't split on it}

\item{num_trees}{The # of trees in the RF. Default is \code{500}.}

\item{boostrap_indices}{An n x num_trees matrix of indices where each column is the bootstrap indices of the training data.
The default is \code{NULL} indicating the default algorithm of sampling {1,...,n} with replacement.}

\item{mtry}{The number of variables tried at every split. The default is \code{NULL} which indicates
the out-of-box RF default which is floor(p / 3) for regression and for classification,
floor(sqrt(p)). If you want a custom function, leave this NULL and see next parameter.}

\item{mtry_fun}{If you wish to create a custom number of mtry, pass in javascript code here as a string.}

\item{nodesize}{The minimum number of observations in a node. YARF will stop splitting at this point.
If \code{NULL} the out-of-the-box default of 5 for regression and 1 for classification 
will be used.}

\item{nodesize_fun}{A custom javascript function to be used to calculate nodesize. The default is \code{NULL} where
nodesize will be calculated as a static constant (see the \code{nodesize} argument).}

\item{cost_calc_fun}{A custom cost calculation for node splits in Javascript. The default is \code{NULL}
which defaults to sum of squared error for regression or sum of entropy for classification.}

\item{node_assign_fun}{A custom node assignment function in Javascript. This function is run after RF greedily finds the 
"lowest cost" split. The default is \code{NULL} corresponding to the sample average of the node responses 
in regression or the modal class during classification.}

\item{aggregation_fun}{A custom javascript function which aggregates the predictions in the trees for one observations 
into one scalar prediction. The default is \code{NULL} corresponding to the sample average for
regression and the modal category for classification.}

\item{use_missing_data}{Use the "missing-in-attributes" to fit data with missingness.}

\item{mem_cache_for_speed}{}

\item{covariates_to_permute}{Indices of features to randomly permute when creating a YARF. The default is \code{NULL}
indicating no features are permuted. This is an argument used mostly by other YARF functions.}

\item{serialize}{Should the YARF model be saved? The default is \code{FALSE} as this is costly in processing 
time and memory. This can only be set to \code{TRUE} if \code{wait = TRUE}. If \code{TRUE},
we will automatically serialize after other operations that add data (such as the OOB evaluation).}

\item{seed}{Set a random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{wait}{Should we hang R to wait for the YARF model to complete? The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{Should we print out messages verbosely during construction? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{debug_log}{Should we print out messages from Java? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{shared_functions}{Custom Javascript functions that are always around. The default is \code{NULL} for no shared functions.}
